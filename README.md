# Task-4-and-5
This repository contains the responses to Task 4 and Task 5 of the Epigenomics Course in the Analysis of Omics Data Master program.

The commands and responses for each task are organized in two separate .txt files:

task4.txt: Contains all the commands and corresponding responses for Task 4, which includes setting up the environment, downloading metadata, retrieving bigBed files, and performing intersection analyses.

task55.txt: Contains all the commands and corresponding responses for Task 5, focusing on further analysis steps, including promoter region intersections and gene body analysis.
These files provide a comprehensive log of the steps taken to analyze ATAC-seq data, from data retrieval to analysis.
